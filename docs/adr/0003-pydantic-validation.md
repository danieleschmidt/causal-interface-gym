# ADR-0003: Pydantic for Data Validation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our system handles complex causal models, interventions, and belief states that need to be validated for correctness. We need to ensure:
- Causal graph definitions are valid DAGs
- Intervention specifications are well-formed
- LLM agent responses conform to expected schemas
- Type safety across Python/JavaScript boundary
- Clear error messages for researchers using the toolkit

## Decision

We will use Pydantic v2 for data validation and serialization because:
1. Automatic validation of causal model constraints (e.g., acyclicity)
2. Type-safe JSON serialization for frontend communication
3. Rich error messages that help researchers debug causal models
4. Integration with FastAPI for potential future API development
5. Performance improvements in v2 for real-time validation

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Catch causal model errors early with clear error messages
- Type safety reduces bugs in causal reasoning logic
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation for future API documentation
- Consistent data handling across all system components

**Negative:**
- Additional dependency and potential version conflicts
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Pydantic
- Validation overhead for high-frequency operations

**Mitigation:**
- Use validation caching for repeated model checks
- Provide validation bypass options for performance-critical paths
- Document common validation patterns for causal models
- Create custom validator helpers for causal inference constraints
