## Recommendations

- Improve code quality by reducing complexity and addressing style violations
- Address security vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-severity issues
- Increase test coverage and fix failing unit tests
- Overall quality score is below target - prioritize highest impact improvements

## Next Actions

1. Run code formatter and refactor high-complexity functions
1. Review and remediate security patterns flagged in the scan
1. Write additional unit tests for uncovered code paths
1. Address 3 failing quality gates before release
