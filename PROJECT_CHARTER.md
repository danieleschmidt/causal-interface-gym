# Causal Interface Gym - Project Charter

*Approved: 2025-08-02 | Version: 1.0*

## Executive Summary

The Causal Interface Gym project develops an open-source toolkit for embedding causal reasoning into interactive user interfaces and systematically measuring how LLM agents understand causation versus correlation. This addresses a critical gap in AI evaluation revealed by Stanford's CausaLM research.

## Problem Statement

### Core Problem
Large Language Models consistently fail at causal reasoning, confusing correlation with causation in ways that can lead to harmful real-world decisions. Current evaluation methods lack systematic approaches to test causal understanding through interactive interfaces.

### Evidence
- Stanford's CausaLM (2025) showed LLMs achieve <60% accuracy on basic causal reasoning tasks
- Existing benchmarks focus on static text, not interactive causal environments
- No standardized toolkit exists for building causal reasoning interfaces
- Researchers lack tools to measure belief evolution during causal interventions

### Impact of Status Quo
- AI systems make incorrect causal assumptions in healthcare, economics, and policy
- Interface designers lack frameworks for teaching causal thinking
- Research community cannot systematically compare LLM causal reasoning abilities
- Educational tools for causality remain disconnected from modern AI evaluation

## Project Scope

### In Scope
1. **Core Causal Engine**: Implementation of Pearl's causal hierarchy and do-calculus
2. **Interactive UI Components**: React components for causal graph manipulation and intervention

4. **Benchmark Suite**: Comprehensive evaluation framework for causal understanding
5. **Educational Resources**: Documentation, tutorials, and example scenarios
6. **Research Applications**: Tools for academic studies on causal interface design

### Out of Scope
1. **Causal Discovery**: Automatic inference of causal structure from data (use existing PyWhy tools)
2. **Production AI Systems**: Building end-user applications (focus on research toolkit)
3. **Non-Causal ML**: General machine learning or statistical inference capabilities
4. **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps (web-based interfaces only)
